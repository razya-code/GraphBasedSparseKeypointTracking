# GraphBasedSparseKeypointTracking

This project extends the capabilities of the original [DINO Tracker](https://github.com/AssafSinger94/dino-tracker) by incorporating GNN-based keypoint tracking, using pseudo labels generated by [PoseAnything](https://github.com/orhir/PoseAnything).

---

## 🔧 Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure to follow the installation and setup instructions in both:
- [DINO Tracker README](https://github.com/AssafSinger94/dino-tracker)
- [PoseAnything README](https://github.com/orhir/PoseAnything)

---

## 🧪 Step 1: Generate Pseudo Labels with PoseAnything

Use `PoseAnything` to generate pose-based pseudo labels:

```bash
python PoseAnything/psuedo_labels_generator.py \
  --support path/to/support.jpg \
  --queries path/to/query1.jpg path/to/query2.jpg \
  --config configs/pose_model_config.py \
  --checkpoint checkpoints/model.pth \
  --outdir output
```

This will produce output in:

```
PoseAnything/readyoutputs/<sequence_name>/pose_results.json
```

---

## ⚙️ Step 2: Convert Pseudo Labels for DINO Tracker GNN

Run the following script to convert the generated pose data to the format expected by `DINO Tracker GNN`:

```bash
python scripts/run_pose_pipeline.py <sequence_name>
```

This will:
- Adjust the JSON structure to match the format expected by DINO Tracker GNN.
- Generate an adjacency matrix and rescaled keypoints.
- Produce:
  - Adjusted `pose_results_adjusted.json`
  - Annotated frames
  - Output video for visualization

---

## 🧠 Step 3: Train the GNN-Based Tracker

Make sure to first **train the original DINO Tracker** and place the relevant checkpoint files as expected (see the DINO Tracker repository for training instructions).

Then, you're ready to train and evaluate the GNN-based DINO Tracker on your pseudo-labeled sequences.
